418Y Software Engineering Final Project

Requirements:
Express JS
Node JS
Angular JS
AWS


So this is an intial push into what the website can look like. We almost have a prototype. This is made to be local hosted, for the sake of simple and precise edits. With local hosting everyone can contribute to the current files and the present filesystem. The presentation layer is local, the service layer is local; BUT the database is hosted on my AWS instance. Its easier to use the same database rather than creating several others that may not all work the same way. Send a message to the group me if you need the login. 


But there are some problems:
The filesystem: Node has a particular way to arrange the files, and i havent made it into one convenient arrangement yet. When this is corrected, anyone can download a file with node and express and run it out of the gate.

4/13/17: Angular is up and running but not yet complete. We need an RESTFUL API to properly connect to the server, and that will help the client along. We also need to map out the website as a whole.  

It will be hosted on "localhost:8080". Just type that into your browser if you decide to run the files.
